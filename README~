This repository holds all the code, auxiliary files, and intermediate files used in Ranjan & Sasselov 2016b. Using this material, one can replicate every one of the figures used in our paper, as well as run models of one's own formulation.

The anticipated use cases are:
1. Testing/Validating the findings of Ranjan & Sasselov 2016b
2. Using the Ranjan & Sasselov radiative transfer model to compute UV surface fluence for user-defined atmospheres and surfaces.

If making use of this code or the generated auxiliary files, please cite the descriptor paper:
Ranjan, S. and Sasselov, Dimitar D. "Constraints on the Terrestrial Prebiotic UV Environment". Submitted to Astrobiology.

Feedback welcome! Please send any comments or questions to: Sukrit Ranjan, sranjan@cfa.harvard.edu
